        <p class="lead">The Spring 2013 team worked on a variety of projects from implementing quality control programs at a local CMU block plant to taking data for design groups in the US. They also assisted a CEDC partner, Tradd Cotter with Mushroom Mountain in training local agronomists in mushroom production, and built the shade and housing structure for the mushroom growing startup program.</p>

        <p class="lead">The Spring 2012 team was one of the largest groups CEDC has sent down, and also had one of the largest tasks for a short term team: to complete installation of the first pump and installation of the three-stage water treatment system. The fact that the team successfully accomplished both tasks in just one week is a testament to the extensive pre-planning and organization efforts of the team in the US and the industry advisor, David Vaughn of Fluor.</p>

The team focused on gathering data to be used by teams in the United States to design solutions to the needs they noted.</p>
