<p>CEDC began in the classroom.  And the class element remains an integral part of the program.  Averaging between 60-80 students per semester, with 25+ majors represented, CEDC offers students college credit for participating in the organization.  Through multi-discleplinary high performance teams, guest speakers, numerous presentations, and networking, CEDC's classroom experience develops students in both their technical skills and soft skills.</p>
<p>Below are just some of the ways we've helped to develop our students and complete our goals:</p>
