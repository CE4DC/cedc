<h1>CEDC in the Classroom</h1>
<div class="line-separator"></div>
<p>CEDC began in the classroom.  And the class element remains an integral part of the program.  
	Averaging between 60-80 students per semester, with 25+ majors represented, 
	CEDC offers students college credit for participating in the organization. 
	Through multi-discleplinary high performance teams, guest speakers, numerous presentations, 
	and networking, CEDC's classroom experience develops students in both their technical and soft skills.</p></div>
