<td><h3>Down the Mountain</h3><p>A crucial part of the Municipal Water System in Cange were the two new pumps in Bas Cange (Lower Cange).   These pumps pushed water up the 1,000 feet elevation change to the treatment and distribution system at the top of the mountain.  All the equipment for these pumps, including the turbines weighing in at over 1,000 pounds, had to be carried down the mountain steps.  Watch our interns oversee the transport of one of these massive turbines down the mountain.</p></td>

		<td><h2>2013: Spring</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Spring 2013 team worked on a variety of projects from implementing quality control programs at a local CMU block plant to taking data for design groups in the US. They also assisted a CEDC partner, Tradd Cotter with Mushroom Mountain in training local agronomists in mushroom production, and built the shade and housing structure for the mushroom growing startup program.</p>

		<td><h2>2012: Fall</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Fall 2013 team focused extensively on completing the final pump installation, completing the construction on the Cange Municipal Water Project. Working with the Haitian construction crew, the team effectively cut installation time in half from the previous pump.</p>

		<td><h2>2012: Spring</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Spring 2012 team was one of the largest groups CEDC has sent down, and also had one of the largest tasks for a short term team: to complete installation of the first pump and installation of the three-stage water treatment system. The fact that the team successfully accomplished both tasks in just one week is a testament to the extensive pre-planning and organization efforts of the team in the US and the industry advisor, David Vaughn of Fluor.</p>

		<td><h2>2011: Fall</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Fall 2011 team began the Adopt-A-Village program village assessments by traveling to six villages and assessing existing water distribution facilities, water quality, and village water resource needs. The team focused on gathering data to be used by teams in the United States to design solutions to the needs they noted.</p>
