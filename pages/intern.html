<h2>Our trips:</h2>
<p>Clemson Engineers for Developing Countries has been involved in numerous trips to the developing world since it's inception.  Below, a few of our recent trips are highlighted!</p>

<td><h3>Down the Mountain</h3><p>A crucial part of the Municipal Water System in Cange were the two new pumps in Bas Cange (Lower Cange).   These pumps pushed water up the 1,000 feet elevation change to the treatment and distribution system at the top of the mountain.  All the equipment for these pumps, including the turbines weighing in at over 1,000 pounds, had to be carried down the mountain steps.  Watch our interns oversee the transport of one of these massive turbines down the mountain.</p></td>

		<td><h2>2015: Spring</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The Spring 2015 team stayed for the longest time ever by a single CEDC team: 10 days. Students worked on a variety of tasks from taking wind readings to investigating locations for another biodigester to assessing the Cange marketplace as a place for business and economic development. The largest project involved the installation of sand filters in Ba Cange so as to reduce sediment loads from the dammed source. Data was also collected to verify whether the construction of a hydroelectric turbine might be feasible to provide electricity to the Zanmi Lasante compound where the interns live</p>

		<td><h2>2014: Fall</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The Fall 2014 team traveled to the small village of Arcahaie (just north of Port-au-Prince) where they worked to install a water system for a local orphanage run by Children’s Lifeline out of Kentucky. This system is very similar to the Cange system; there are three stages of treatment: filtration, UV, and chlorine. Thanks to the tireless effort by the project teams in the classroom, the actual construction only took two days. Clemson students also taught the locals there how to test the system to ensure that it will effectively deliver clean water to the hundreds of orphans who live there.</p>

		<td><h2>2013: Spring</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Spring 2013 team worked on a variety of projects from implementing quality control programs at a local CMU block plant to taking data for design groups in the US. They also assisted a CEDC partner, Tradd Cotter with Mushroom Mountain in training local agronomists in mushroom production, and built the shade and housing structure for the mushroom growing startup program.</p>

		<td><h2>2013: Fall</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Fall 2013 team focused mainly on data collection for project teams in the classroom. Groups did everything from gathering information about the local road situation to interviewing local farmers on the best way to help them improve their crop. There were also several meetings to begin the partnership between CEDC and ACEDLP, a local organization that acts as a co-op for farmers in Ba Cange</p>

		<td><h2>2012: Fall</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Fall 2013 team focused extensively on completing the final pump installation, completing the construction on the Cange Municipal Water Project. Working with the Haitian construction crew, the team effectively cut installation time in half from the previous pump.</p>

		<td><h2>2012: Spring</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Spring 2012 team was one of the largest groups CEDC has sent down, and also had one of the largest tasks for a short term team: to complete installation of the first pump and installation of the three-stage water treatment system. The fact that the team successfully accomplished both tasks in just one week is a testament to the extensive pre-planning and organization efforts of the team in the US and the industry advisor, David Vaughn of Fluor.</p>

		<td><h2>2011: Fall</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Fall 2011 team began the Adopt-A-Village program village assessments by traveling to six villages and assessing existing water distribution facilities, water quality, and village water resource needs. The team focused on gathering data to be used by teams in the United States to design solutions to the needs they noted.</p>
