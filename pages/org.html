<p>The organization and the class of CEDC function as a business with an heirarchical organization structure, allowing students to work in administrative-oriented teams (Finance, Current Operations, Communications, and Content Mangement), project-based teams, and education-oriented teams.  This structure allows the organization to function smoothly, while supporting the project operations on the ground in Haiti and sustaining organizational growth.</p>
