<center><h1>Chapoteau: 2012</h1></center>

<p>While work is still underway for the first implementation of the Sustainable Living Solution system, one village, Chapoteau, was well equipped with water facilities but needed repairs and modifications, and work was able to begin prior to SLS design finalization.</p>
<p>The major initial need in Chapoteau was the repair of the piping from the source to the facilities downhill (cisterns and fountains).  This phase of work in Chapoteau has been completed.  Further phases of work include testing water quality and implementing treatment facilities if necessary.</p>

<p>The SLS is a holistic solution approach complete with a well and pump system, elevated cistern to store and distribute water, a latrine to provide sanitary restroom facilities, biodigestor and constructed wetlands for treatment of the waste, and a communal kitchen fed with harvested methane from the biodigestor treatment.  A model for the Sustainable Living Solution can be seen below.</p>
