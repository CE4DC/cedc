<center><h1>Cange Municipal Water Project: 2009 to 2012</h1></center>

<p>The first and keystone project of CEDC: the Cange Municipal Water Project is a water treatment and distribution project for the village of Cange. This 1.2 million dollar project was financed by the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina (EDUSC) as part of their "Partnership Cange" relationship and serves roughly 10,000 people with potable water.</p>
<p>The facilities, constructed and installed with oversight from CEDC interns over the span of 1 1/2 years, include nine fountain/showers, four cisterns with a total capacity of 200,000 gallons and pumping system that can deliver 144,000 gallons of water per day up 1,100 feet through nearly two miles of four-inch galvanized pipe.  The water is filtered, sterilized, and cholorinated, providing clean drinking water to inhabitants of Cange.</p>
