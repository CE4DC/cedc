<center><h1>Domond Block Plant Consultation: 2012</h1></center>

<p>Domond, a roughly ten minute drive south of Cange, houses a start-up CMU (concrete masonry unit) block plant.  Part of an initiative known as "1000 Jobs for Haiti", the plant has been unable to reach ASTM standard quality block, a prerequisite for selling to major purchases of block in Haiti.  CEDC, along with help from industry partner CEMEX, has begun consulting on aggregate quality, mixing and compacting procedure, proper equipment use, and testing, with the goal of achieving ASTM standard block.  Once this standard is reached, the plant can begin supplying to larger buyers and expand as a business, creating more jobs in the area. </p>
