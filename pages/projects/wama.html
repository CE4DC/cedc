<h2>Mission statement:</h2>
<p>To design a waste management system that empowers the local people to achieve sustainable waste disposal 
while benefiting both the sanitation and environmental quality of Cange.</p>

<h2>Project description:</h2>
<p>In Cange, Haiti there is no system for managing trash.  Trash is discarded anywhere, collecting and posing
serious environmental and santiational issues, and it is a social norm to just throw trash anywhere.  Waste
Management's goal is to educate the people in Cange about waste management while also providing a facility
to help manage waste.</p>
