<center><h1>Cange External Clinic Latrine, Biodigestor, Wetlands, Methane Gas recycling: 2011 to 2013</h1></center>

<p>The Cange External Clinic Latrine, Biodigestor, and Wetlands project began construction in 2012 and was completed in 2013.  It was created as an effort to provide sanitary restroom facilities to the patients treated at the External Clinic at the hospital in Cange, while treating waste sustainably.  The facility has Mens/Womens sections, with waste flowing to three biodigestor bags.  In these bags, the waste is treated during its average 70 day retention time.  The treated waste leaves the bags and enters the constructed wetlands.  Methane gas created in the treatment process in the digestor bags in harvested and sent to a communal kitchen.</p>
