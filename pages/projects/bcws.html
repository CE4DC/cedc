<center><h1>Ba Cange Water System</h1></center>

<p>The Cange Water System carries water from Ba Cange to the greater Cange area where it is treated and distributed to the residents of the community that live along National Route 3. However, clean water is not returned to the community of Ba Cange where people are forced to walk over 500 stairs to reach a clean water source. Consequently, citizens would drink the contaminated water in the Ba Cange leading to several cholera cases in summer 2015.  In response, CEDC designed and built a small water treatment system in one of the CEDC pump-houses to allow those that live in Ba Cange to access clean water as well. This project was funded by Christ Church in Greenville, SC and completed in August 2015.</p>
