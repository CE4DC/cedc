<center><h1>Ecole Bon Saveur Latrines</h1></center>

<p>Construction for the latrines for the Ecole Bon Saveur school started in 2014 and was completed in 2015. This 
major project provided flush toilets and urinals for the hundreds of students who attend this local Episcopal school 
in Cange. Prior to their completion, all children were forced to use revolting pit latrines that were neither pleasant 
on the senses nor sanitary. Today, children at the school and in the surrounding community can use these flush toilets 
that carry waste from the school all the way to the CEDC biodigester system near the health clinic in the Zanmi Lasante 
compound where it is disposed of properly and safely.</p>
