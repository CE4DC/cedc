<center><h1>Belle Aire Triage Water Treatment Installation: 2011 to 2013</h1></center>

<p>The Belle Aire Triage Water Treatment project is part of the Adopt-A-Village intiative of one of our chief partners, the EDUSC (Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina).  19 villages in the central plateau surrounding Cange were visited, and assessed for current water facilities and conditions.  Belle Aire was the worst assessed in terms of water quality, and was the candidate for the first triage water system.  The system includes a four stage filtration system and solar powered UV light treatment to provide potable water at the source for the people in the village.  Upon completion, water was tested to be clean and potable.</p>
