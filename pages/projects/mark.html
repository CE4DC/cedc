<h2>Mission statement:</h2>
<p>To develop a safe and functioning marketplace in Cange, Haiti.</p>

<h2>Project description:</h2>
<p>The current marketplace in Cange, Haiti runs into the streets, endangering travelers and customers, 
and has little room for expansion, limiting the local economy.  Marketplace aims to develop a new marketplace,
stimulating the economy in Cange and the surrounding areas and to offer a comprehensive proposal of the marketplace
including the materials, costs, schedule, and location of the future marketplace to the city of Cange, Haiti.</p>
