<center><h1>Morne Michel School Repairs</h1></center>

<p>In 2015, CEDC and Trinity Cathedral in Columbia, SC worked together to repair the St. Jean School 
at the village of Morne Michel in the Central Plateau of Haiti. Interns worked to create a solution 
to the terrible drainage around the courtyard, the leaking school roof, and eroding foundation along 
with providing light at night so students could study and adults could take nightly literacy classes. 
After several weeks of grueling hikes and hard labor, the school children had a brand new courtyard, 
new roof, solar panels with lightbulbs, and a reinforced foundation at their school.</p>
