<center><h1>Social Regulation of Water System and Infrastructure In Cange</h1></center>

<p>A major issue facing Cange is ownership, regulation, and maintainance of the water system and other infrastructure in Cange. CEDC has partnered with EDUSC to have a full-time Intern work on organizing a governing body representative of all social groups in Cange that can oversee the water system and infrastucture. The end goal is to have complete and functional local ownership of any and all engineering projects implemented in Cange.</p>
