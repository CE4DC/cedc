<center><h1>Arcahaie Water System</h1></center>

<p>One of CEDC’s few projects outside the Central Plateau, the Arcahaie Water System project consisted of upgrading an 
old water treatment system for an orphanage in Arcahaie, Haiti (just north of Port-au-Prince). CEDC partnered with 
Children’s Lifeline, an NGO out of Kentucky, to finance and implement this fast-track project because several orphans 
began suffering from cholera due to ineffective treatment. From problem identification to execution, the entire project 
was completed in just 12 weeks in late 2014. Water testing before and after our finished treatment system display that 
hundreds of orphans are no longer exposed to cholera and other deadly pathogens.</p>
