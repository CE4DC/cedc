<p>In the fall of 2012, CEDC received over $50,000 in scholarship funds from endowments to the Clemson University Service Learning Alliance to support 17 service learning scholarships.  The CEDC Scholars Program provides scholarships to sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates and graduate students from academic disciplines across the Clemson University campus to work with local communities in the Central Plateau of Haiti developing and implementing sustainable solutions to improve public health and quality of life.</p>
<p>The CEDC Scholars Program emphasizes civic engagement and global leadership and offers recipients the opportunity to learn about sustainable development, community building and cultural diversity.  Those selected as CEDC Scholars have exhibited (while in high school and during their freshman/sophomore years at Clemson) strong leadership skills, a commitment to academic success, and a true desire to give back to the world community through volunteerism and service.   In total, these scholars will generate over 5,000 hours of service credit over the course of a year.</p>
<p>The purpose of the CEDC Scholars Program is to continue to build student skills and talents through academic endeavors as well as provide opportunities to learn more about global engagement and public service while continuing volunteerism at Clemson. The CEDC Scholar program is overseen by Joshua Mitchell, the CEDC Program Director.  In addition, the program benefits from the commitment of the Industry Advisor/Instructor, David Vaughn from the Fluor Corporation.  Mr. Vaughn helps coordinate projects with funding partners, oversees progress meetings between sponsors and CEDC team members, and provides instruction on relevant topics during the weekly meetings as needed.</p>
<p>This year a total of 17 students received CEDC Scholars awards including:</p>
